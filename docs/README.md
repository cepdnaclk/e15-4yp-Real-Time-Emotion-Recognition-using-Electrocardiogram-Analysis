## Abstract
Automated Human Emotion Recognition is an important subject in the modern world
since human computer interaction is increasingly utilized in almost every field including
healthcare, entertainment, automotive industry etc. A lot of research has been conducted
related to this area using different emotion recognition methods. There are various
methods of emotion recognition such as; analysing data obtained by biosensors, by
using facial and eye activity recognition technologies and by using speech recognition
technologies. Analysing data collected by biosensors can be considered as an effective
method to recognise emotions since the subject can not hide or force his/her emotions
when data is obtained. Mostly used biosensors are Electromyography (EMG), Heart Rate
(HR), Electrocardiography (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), Blood Pressure and
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Here, ECG can be considered as a good biosignal since it
contains emotion related information. This research focuses on recognizing both human
and animal emotions using ECG signal analysis. Most of the ECG analysis based emotion
recognition studies use different types of machine learning techniques. Main problem
with these methods is lack of accuracy and not having the ability to classify emotions
real-time. The main objective of this study is to identify an extended range of emotions
with higher accuracy in real-time. The proposed method is to use a large dataset to
increase accuracy and to implement a Convolutional Neural Network to identify emotions
real time.
